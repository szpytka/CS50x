    <h4>A Few Notes on Care</h4>
    <hr class="solid">
    <p>
      Caring for floofballs requires a <em>little bit</em> of effort, <em>not</em> an outstanding degree of it. I'll list some important factors
      here without going into too much depth, and then point you to some resources for your further investigation (and as a
      good, responsible guinea pig owner, I <em>know</em> you will be doing further investigations :D).
    </p>
    <!-- Cage section -->
    <h4>Cages</h4>
    <hr class="solid">
    <p>
      Don't even think about buying one of those small, metal cages you see at the store. Even for one pig, that is not enough space.
      Putting a pig in a cage like that would be like putting <em>you</em> in a janitor's closet for the rest of your life. Do you want to
      live in a janitor's closet? Didn't think so.<br><br>

      Pigs need space to run around so they can live happy lives. To prance with glee amongst plentitudes of strewn hay and poop pellets. Do not deny them this joy.<br><br>

      BAD cage:<br><br>

               border-radius: 8px;"><br><br>

      <b>Good cages</b> have a lot of space (with hiding places for guinea pigs to run to if they feel threatened).
      These cages can come in many different forms that you can either build yourself or buy prebuilt.

      <br><br>Here's an example of a GREAT cage:<br><br>

               border-radius: 8px;"><br><br>

      Here's a video on how to build a great C&C (Cubes and Coroplast) cage (for about $40), similar to what you see
      in the image above (YouTube channel: Scotty's Animals):<br><br>

    <!-- Diet section -->
    <h4>Diet</h4>
    <hr class="solid">
    <p>
      What a guinea pig eats is very important! Eating too much or too little of what they require can cause sickness in these little furballs.<br><br>
      Guinea pig diets should consist of water, timothy hay, timothy-hay based pellets, fresh fruits, and fresh vegetables.
      Good quality hay should be their staple food. Pellets come second to that, and fruits and vegetables should be served
      in moderation per this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.guineapigcages.com/forum/threads/22156-READ-ME-Cavy-Nutrition-Charts-amp-Poisonous-Plants-List">nutrition chart</a>.
      Preserved treats and snacks should generally be avoided, as they can contain ingredients that may be harmful to a guinea
      pig's health!<br><br>

    <h4>Social Environment</h4>
    <hr class="solid">
    <h5 class="indent" style="margin-top: 30px">Furball Friends for Your Furball</h5>
    <p>
      Piggles are social animals. That said, they should have piggle friends to live and play with. Imagine if you had no
      humans to interact with and only an alien overlord to talk to. That might get weird. So do your guinea pig a favor,
      and get them another guinea pig (or pigs)!<br><br>

      Look at these guinea pigs just hanging out (YouTube Channel: It's Pigs!):
      <br><br>
      <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XoD_H9x_DF0" height="300" width="600" title="Guinea pigs hanging out via It's Pigs!"></iframe>
    </p>
    <h5 class="indent" style="margin-top: 30px">Non-furball Friends for Your Furball</h5>
    <p>
      That means you. You can be a friend to your guinea pig. That means respecting it as an autonomous living creature and
      not treating it like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pxvzEfI0BFU">Elmyra from Tiny Toon Adventures</a>
      does her pets.<br><br>

      Once and only once you're buddy-buddy and your guinea pig actually likes you a lot, may you commence with the cuddling.
      Before that happens, you can talk to the little squeaker, feed it, and get it used to you holding it. More on taming your
      guinea pig in the following video (YouTube Channel: Scotty's Animals):<br><br>

    <h4 class="indent" style="margin-top: 30px">Playtime</h4>
    <hr class="solid">
    <p style="margin-bottom: 30px">
      Imagine that you had to stay inside of your room ALL the time. It would feel like prison right? Well, if you don't
      want your guinea pigs to feel like prisoners, you should let them out to PLAY.<br><br> Could just be inside a room,
      could be in a small enclosure within the room, could even be outside in the grass (just be wary of other animals
      (including birds) that might prey on your guinea pigs). As long as they get some time outside of their cage to run
      around, you can ensure yourself a happy furball. 10-20 minutes a day should do!<br><br>
